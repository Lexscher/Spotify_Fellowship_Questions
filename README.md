# Greetings!

I made this repository for my Spotify Fellowship application. I'll answer each technical question in it's own file. I'll be using JavaScript to solve these questions.

So you may navigate to the questions easily from here:
| Question | Link |
|----------|------|
| 1 | [Sort By String](https://github.com/Lexscher/Spotify_Fellowship_Questions/blob/master/js/Q1.js) |
| 2 | [Decode Strings](https://github.com/Lexscher/Spotify_Fellowship_Questions/blob/master/js/Q2.js) |
| 3 | [Change Possibilities](https://github.com/Lexscher/Spotify_Fellowship_Questions/blob/master/js/Q3.js) |

##### Thank you for taking an interest in my code.

### Best,

## Alexander
